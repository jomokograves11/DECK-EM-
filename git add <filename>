Card Class:
 * Encapsulates card attributes and potential methods for card actions.
class Card:
    def __init__(self, image, word, suit, color, type):
        self.image = image
        self.word = word
        self.suit = suit
        self.color = color
        self.type = type

Populating the Deck:
 * Use the create_deck function to generate a list of Card objects.
 * Consider creating different card types (picture, word, special) and their specific attributes.
Game Logic
Game State:
 * Keep track of players, their hands, the deck, cards on the table, and the current player's turn.
 * Use a dictionary or custom class to store game state information.
Game Flow:
 * Implement functions for dealing cards, drawing cards, playing cards, forming melds, checking for win conditions, and handling player turns.
 * Consider using a state machine or event-driven approach for complex game logic.
class Game:
    def __init__(self, num_players):
        self.deck = create_deck()
        self.players = [Player() for _ in range(num_players)]
        # ... other game state variables

    def deal_cards(self):
        # Deal initial cards to players and table
        pass

    def play_turn(self, player):
        # Logic for a player's turn
        pass

    def check_win_condition(self):
        # Check if a player has won
        pass

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Create game window
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))

# Load card images
card_images = {}
# ... load images

# Game loop
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # Draw game elements
    screen.fill((255, 255, 255))
    # ... draw cards, players, etc.

    pygame.display.flip()

class GameState:
    def __init__(self, num_players):
        self.players = [Player() for _ in range(num_players)]
        self.deck = Deck()
        self.discard_pile = []
        self.table = []  # Cards played on the table
        self.current_player = 0
        self.winning_meld_count = 7  # Adjust based on player count

Game Flow and Actions
We can outline the core game loop and player actions:
class Game:
    def __init__(self, num_players):
        self.state = GameState(num_players)
        self.deal_initial_cards()

    def deal_initial_cards(self):
        # Deal cards to players and table
        pass

    def play_turn(self):
        current_player = self.state.players[self.state.current_player]
        # Implement player actions: draw, play, discard, pass
        # Check for melds, update game state, check for win condition
        self.state.current_player = (self.state.current_player + 1) % len(self.state.players)

    def check_win_condition(self):
        # Check if a player has reached the winning meld count or emptied their hand
        pass

Implementing the is_valid_meld Function

Basic Implementation (Dictionary-Based):
valid_melds = {
    ('image1', 'word2'): True,
    ('image3', 'word4'): True,
    # ... other valid melds
}

def is_valid_meld(cards):
  card_attributes = tuple((card.image, card.word) for card in cards)
  return card_attributes in valid_melds
